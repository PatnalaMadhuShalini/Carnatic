    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        Sankaracharya(788-820 A.D.) was bornin a family of Nambudiribrahman sect in a village called Kaladi in the State of Kerala. His parents were pious couple having deep religious culture. His father was a priest in a Shiva temple.
         In the times of Sankaracharya, there was no powerful king in south India; and this period noticed the rise of bhakti movement. Brahmans were the dominating group of people through their behaviour and divinely oriented life.
          He received necessary training in Vedic recital and study. He also attained proficiency in languages in his early age. His father died when he was only 7 years old. He exhibited extraordinary intelligence in his boyhood, mastering all the then-current theologies and philosophies by the age of 17. 
          A number of miracles are associated with his life. One of which is as follows:

        According to the divine wish,Sankaracharya had to become a religious teacher, Sannyasin; but his mother was not interested in it. 
        One day it is said that a miracle happened: When he was taking bath in a nearby river, a crocodile caught hold of his leg and dragged him; his mother saw and cried.
        Then he asked his mother to give permission to take Sannyasin, so that the crocodile might leave him according to the divine wish. At this crucial hour his mother agreed, and he was released from the jaws of the crocodile dramatically. Thus he had become a Sannyasinto take up his chosen divine mission.

    His mission was not to bring quarrel among various theological systems but to see that a sprit of unity prevails.
     He interpreted the theology of Upanisads and preached it for the benefit of humanity, as people are misguided with false doctrines. He travelled whole India.
      In his journey, it is said that he met many people including Govinda, and Gaudapada (who wrote verse commentaries on the Upanisads, the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahma Sutra in Benaras).
